<h1> Sitting on the porch in Vermont</h1>
<h2>Quite a lovely view</h2>

<div class= "horse">
	<p>A lone horse <br>
	<small>This horse has no friends. That is very sad, I hope he can make some soon. Every horse deserves a friend or two, especially in Vermont. </small>
	</p> 
</div>

<div class="cows">
	<p> Look at these cows <br>
	<small>They are quite popular. People in Vermont love cows. That horse should paint some spots on himself and pretend he is one.</small>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="wahoo">
	<p> WAHOOOO!<br>
	<small>Isn't Vermont so fun? Lets go down to the ropeswing, invite the horse he deserves to have a good time.</small>
